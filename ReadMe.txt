The NBA_stats_clean contains code (Python and R), dataset and documentations
for the SEIS785 course project "Stories behind the NBA Stats".

Before running, make sure that you have a unix-like shell, Python and R installed correctly.

To run:

execute the following command in sequence in a unix shell
(if you are a Window user, using Cygwin instead.)

chmod 755 run.sh

./run.sh

After the shell program is done, you will see a database file generated under db directory
and graphs generated under graphs directory.

To clean up the generated files:

chmod 755 cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
